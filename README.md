## 1. Introduction
Using either the **Arduino IDE 2.0.x** [available here](https://bit.ly/Arduino2v0_IDE) or the **Visual Studio Code (PlatformIO) IDE** I'll talk you through getting a simple web page to be served up from your ESP32 (yes, the ESP8266 works too, but you will have to read the information on the libraries to make it work).

## 2a. Installing the libraries (Arduino method)
Go to [the following GitHub site](https://github.com/me-no-dev) and download the following libraries:

1. ESPAsyncWebServer
2. AsyncTCP (if you are using ESP8266 download ESPsyncTCP instead)

Go to the [following GitHub site](https://github.com/ayushsharma82/AsyncElegantOTA) and download the following library:

1. AsyncElegantOTA

They will download as ZIP files with the suffix _-master_. Ignore all that! Just remember where you downloaded them to!   
Go to the Arduino IDE and click Sketch-> Include Library -> Add.ZIP library and click the downloaded library ZIP files.  
Done!  

## 2b. Installing the libraries (PlatformIO method)
Ensure your _platformio.ini_ file includes the ```lib_deps``` like this:

## 3. All code for both environments is in this GitHub!

Just click big green "CODE" button above and choose the ZIP file download to your PC. Then unzip and you have _everything_ you might need!
